								<p class="txt_em">What is “TextAlive App API”?</p>
								<p>"TextAlive App API" is a JavaScript library for developing web applications to animate lyrics that synchronize with the music playback. It uses features from "TextAlive," a web based creativity support tool for authoring "lyric videos," videos in which lyrics of musical pieces are animated as kinetic typography. It helps developers unleash their creativity through programming; it can be used with your favorite creative coding libraries such as Three.js, PixiJS, p5.js, etc.</p>
								<p class="br_s">*TextAlive and TextAlive App API are researched and developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and are publicly available on the web.</p>

									<h3>Entry Rules</h3>
								</div>
								<p class="br_t">The entrant to this contest (hereinafter referred to as the "Entrant") must agree to all the terms and conditions set forth below before entering the contest.</p>
								<ul class="bar br_t">
									<li>This contest is sponsored by Crypton Future Media, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Sponsor"), with technology provided by the RecMus Project of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.</li>
									<li>In this contest, "selected" or "selection" refer to having passed the preliminary screening by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor, and "prize" means a prize determined through public voting for the selected entries and evaluation by a panel of judges.</li>
									<li>There are no prerequisites for entering the contest. Entries may be submitted regardless of whether or not programming is the object of your profession or research. However, if the Entrant is a minor, he or she must obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian to enter the contest and to abide by the "Rules of Entry" before submitting his or her entry.</li>
									<li>If produced in collaboration by multiple people as a team, please submit a team name.</li>
									<li>The program that the Entrant submits to this contest (hereinafter referred to as the "Program") must be an original work. It is allowed to submit a modified version of a program designed or developed previously, but in such case, the Entrant must confirm that the act of submitting the modified Program does not violate the "Rules for Entry" and does not cause any infringement of rights or other problems or obstacles, and then submit the modified program to the contest. The Entrant must ensure that no damage, loss, liability or expense (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Damages") will be incurred by the Sponsor. The submission of a program produced as part of a company's business is not permitted.</li>
									<li>The source code of the program is considered as part of the submission and will be fully reviewed. Please submit your program without any machine processing that would make the source code difficult to read, and make the source code content as clear as possible. It is recommended to include explanations of the program structure to aid the review process.</li>
									<li>As a general rule, the Program must be conceived and developed independently by the Entrant, and the Entrant must own all copyrights, patent rights, and other intellectual property rights (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Intellectual Property Rights").</li>
									<li>In the event that a third party's intellectual property is used in the Program, the Entrant agrees to provide the Sponsor with the appropriate Intellectual Property Rights in advance in order to prevent any problems or hindrances to the entry in this contest. You warrant that you have taken all necessary steps to ensure that your entry has been handled properly. In the event that a third party files an objection to the Program on the grounds of infringement or threatened infringement of Intellectual Property Rights held by such third party, the Entrant shall respond to such objection at its own expense and responsibility and shall not cause any damage or any other inconvenience to the Sponsor. In addition, if the Sponsor suffers any damages or other loss due to the responsibility of the Entrant, the Entrant shall be liable for compensation to the Company, the Sponsor, and others.</li>
									<li>The Sponsor will check the contents of the submitted Program in advance before releasing it to the public. In principle, the Entrant shall not be held responsible for any malfunctions that may occur as a result of the organizer's use of the submitted Program. However, this shall not apply if the Program is submitted with a dishonest purpose, such as an attempt to cause damage to the Sponsor or damage the social reputation of the Sponsor.</li>
									<li>Personal information submitted to the Sponsor upon entry will be acquired and managed by the Sponsor and will be used solely for the purpose of contacting the Entrant regarding the contest, except for personal information submitted by the Entrant in the name of the creator of the Program or that which the Entrant has publicized or indicated an intention to publicize for other purposes. Except as otherwise required by law, personal information will not be provided to any third party without the consent of the Entrant.</li>
									<li>Intellectual property rights and other rights to the Program will continue to belong to the Entrant after entry to the contest. However, in the event that the Entrant's Program wins a prize in the contest, the Entrant agrees to grant the Sponsor the right to freely use (including adapt or alter) the prize-winning Program without limitation for a certain period of time, or to grant permission to a third party to use (including adapt or alter) it without limitation. In addition, the Entrant shall not exercise any intellectual property rights or other rights with respect to the use of the Program by the Sponsor or any third party designated by the Sponsor.</li>
									<li>The Sponsor may use the Program, along with the name of the Entrant and other information submitted to the contest, in print and electronic media for the purpose of publicity, advertising, and notification by the Sponsor or a third party designated by the Sponsor in Japan and abroad.</li>
									<li>If selected, the Program will be shown at the "Magical Mirai 2024" venue, on the official website, and on SNS such as YouTube and X (Twitter). What will be made public are demo videos created under the auspices of the organizer and web applications that anyone can try out. Entrants may not refuse to do so.</li>
									<li>The contestant may announce that they are participating in this contest via their own websites or social media. However, during the submission period, it is prohibited to tease the contents of the program or post demo videos, explanations, etc. After the submission period, the contestant may publish the program, its source code (including images and other assets), demo videos, explanation videos, articles, etc.</li>
									<li>Between the submission of the program and the announcement of the prize-winning entries, the contestant may not update the program, its source code, or any accompanying assets. For the contents the contestant may publish after the submission period as described in the previous term, the contestant must use the same version of the program that was originally submitted so that the entry will not be misinterpreted as being different during public voting. Those found in violation will be disqualified.</li>
									<li>The contestant must not misrepresent the program as if it were conceived, developed, or otherwise involved by the Sponsor.</li>
									<li>The "Rules of Entry" are subject to change at any time. A history of such changes will be included in the revised Rules of Entry. Entrants who have submitted the Program before the changes will be presumed to have continued to agree to the revised Rules of Application as long as they continue to apply to the contest.</li>
